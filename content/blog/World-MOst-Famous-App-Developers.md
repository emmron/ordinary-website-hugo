My thoughts on this year (so far!)

  ### A sample heading

  First week down.

 My thoughts on this year (so far!)

 Swallow the frog.
 You can get the least enjoyable tasks done early while that coffee is still warm. Putting things off is suitable for no one.

 Clarity > Creativity.
 The clever copy will never trump results. Keep It Simple Stupid still applies in getting conversations. Too many agencies think prospects will read their "clever" ad copy.

 Don't name it.
 Most people know what an "audit" is and what a "marketing plan" looks like. Don't go calling this something else or packaging up everything and calling it a fancy name. That's just dumb. Buy our "Digital Starter"; it's an onsite SEO audit, PPC audit and UX audit and... all for a crazy low price... Digital marketing with a scattergun approach is just wasteful.

 Websites < Landing Pages for lead generation
 Websites are for e-commerce, SEO and Direct only. If people want to learn more about you, they can go there. Everything else should be audience divided and sent to the appropriate landing page to convert. Your lead generation activities to your website will never outperform a landing page built for that exact audience.

 Try loads of different things this year :) #digitalmarketing
